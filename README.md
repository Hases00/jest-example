# Installation
Run the following commands to get the required libraries set up:
```
npm install
```

Then, you can run tests with:
```
npm run test
```

You can now change code as you like until you see all tests pass!

## How did we get here?
Note: I've already done the following for this repo. The steps below are only applicable
if you want to add jest to a new project or an existing one that *doesn't already have jest 
set up*.

1. First, you need a node project. You can create one with the following command:
```
npm init -y
```

2. Next you need to need to install jest:
```
npm install -D jest
```

3. Write tests!
Take a look at `./math.test.js` for example. Do note that `.test.` being in the name is important!


## Where can I learn more?
Head on over to the [Jest documentation](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)!
